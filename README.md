Machine Learning Nanodegree - Udacity

As a Teaching Assistance of Udacity China, I got full access to Machine Learning Nanodegree as a mentor welfare, though there would be no credential for graduation. This is the repsitory for recording all projects I accomplished that related to machine learning and relevant fields at Udacity. Nanodegrees involved are listed below:

* Data Analytics Nanodegree
  - Intro to Machine Learning
* Machine Learning Nanodegree
  - 
* Deep Learning Nanodegree
* Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree.

The projects served as guides of artificial intelligence for me several years ago. Though a little bit introductory and outdated, they may still have value to be remembered.
