Machine Learning Nanodegree - Udacity

As a Teaching Assistance of Udacity China, I got full access to Machine Learning Nanodegree as a mentor welfare, though there would be no credential for graduation. This is the repsitory for listing all projects I accomplished that related to machine learning and relevant fields at Udacity. Nanodegrees involved are listed below:

* Data Analytics Nanodegree
  - Intro to Machine Learning
* Machine Learning Nanodegree
  - Housing Price of Boston
  - Finding Donors for CharityML
  - Driverless Car
  - Capstone Project (graduate dissertation)
* Deep Learning Nanodegree
  - The First Neural Network
  - Image Classification
  - Language Translation
  - TV Script Generation
   - Face Generation
* Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree.
  - Sudoko
  - Air Cargo Problems
  - Planning Graph
  - Game Agent

The projects served as guides of artificial intelligence for me several years ago. Though a little bit introductory and outdated, they may still have value to be recorded.
